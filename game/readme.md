# Move Square: Behavior Cloning

Move the blue circle fully inside the white, black-bordered target without touching the screen border. While a person plays, the program records game states and actions. A small PyTorch network then learns to imitate those actions.

## Learning workflow

From the repository root, create and activate a virtual environment, then install the package:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1       # Windows PowerShell
python -m pip install -e .
```

Open the beginner menu:

```bash
python -m behavior_cloning_game
```

The original scripts remain useful for seeing each step explicitly. Run them from `game/`:

```bash
cd game
python play.py --episodes 10 --seed 7
python inspect_data.py data/demonstrations_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
python train.py data/demonstrations_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv --preset quick
```

To add demonstrations to a schema-v2 dataset, resume it explicitly:

```bash
python play.py --dataset data/demonstrations_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
```

The collector validates the file and continues numbering after its highest episode ID. Legacy datasets are readable for training but cannot be appended to because they do not contain schema and outcome columns.

`train.py --help` lists configurable epochs, learning rate, batch size, hidden size/layers, validation fraction, seed, and output directory. The trainer splits whole episodes into training and validation sets, normalizes position features, and saves portable `.pth` weights plus self-describing `.json` metadata.

To remove no-op actions from only the training partition while leaving the raw CSV and validation partition unchanged:

```bash
python train.py data/demonstrations_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv --downsample drop-noop
```

Run `python train.py --list-downsamplers` to discover installed workspace plugins. The experiment metadata records the plugin name, source hash, before/after row counts, and any episode left empty by filtering. See [Downsampling plugins](../docs/downsampling-plugins.md) for the extension contract.

Watch the trained model using the printed weights path without `.pth`:

```bash
python execute.py data/model_RUN_ID
```

The game window opens by default and runs 20 attempts. Change the count with `--episodes`. For reproducible metrics without a window, add `--headless`; use `--output evaluation.json` to save those results.

## What the data means

Each recorded row pairs a state with the action the player chose:

- Features `X`: blue-circle bounding-box position (`blue_x`, `blue_y`) and target position (`target_x`, `target_y`)
- Labels `y`: horizontal and vertical movement (`action_x`, `action_y`)
- Episode context: step, elapsed time, and outcome

Use `inspect_data.py` before training to find sparse, repetitive, or directionally biased demonstrations. The current network predicts continuous action values and trains with mean squared error (MSE).

## Teaching materials

- [Five-minute quick start](../docs/quickstart.md)
- [Seven guided lessons](../docs/lessons.md)
- [Instructor guide](../docs/instructor-guide.md)

The unified command-line menu and finite seeded evaluation are available now. A graphical menu, automated corrective-demonstration workflow, comparison charts, and optional nine-class action model remain planned extensions; they are not required for the current workflow.

## Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Keep reusable behavior in `util/`, orchestration in the entry scripts, and generated learning artifacts out of version control unless they are intentional fixtures.
